# Background
Customers have purchasing transactions that we shall be monitoring to get intuition behind each customer behavior to target the customers in the most efficient and proactive way, to increase sales/revenue, improve customer retention, and decrease churn.

## Q1: Using OnlineRetail dataset
- Write  analytical SQL queries that tell a story about the data.
- Write a small description about the business meaning behind each query.

## Q2: After exploring the data, required to implement a Monetary model for customers' behavior for product purchasing and segment each customer based on the below groups:
- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- Potential Loyalists
- Recent Customers
- Promising
- Customers Needing Attention
- At Risk
- Can't Lose Them
- Hibernating
- Lost

The customers will be grouped based on 3 main values:
- **Recency**: How recent the last transaction is (Hint: choose a reference date, which is the most recent purchase in the dataset).
- **Frequency**: How many times the customer has bought from our store.
- **Monetary**: How much each customer has paid for our products.
